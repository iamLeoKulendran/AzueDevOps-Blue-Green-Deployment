# CI/CD Pipeline with Blue-Green Deployment using Azure DevOps

This project demonstrates a robust, cloud-native CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, hosted on Azure App Service, and implements a blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime releases. The pipeline automates build, test, and deployment stages, ensuring high reliability, fast delivery, and safe rollbacks.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Automated CI/CD:** Source code changes trigger builds, automated tests, and deployments via Azure DevOps pipelines.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Uses Azure App Service deployment slots to enable seamless, zero-downtime production releases and instant rollbacks.
- **Cloud Hosting:** Application is hosted on Azure App Service, benefiting from managed infrastructure, auto-scaling, and integrated security.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Azure DevOps (Pipelines, Repos)
- Azure App Service (Deployment Slots)
- YAML Pipeline Definitions
- Git
- [Your App Stack: Node.js/.NET/Python, etc.]

## üìà Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push changes to Azure Repos.
2. **Build (CI):** Azure DevOps builds the project, runs tests, and publishes artifacts.
3. **Release (CD):** Pipeline deploys to the staging (green) slot on Azure App Service.
4. **Validation:** Automated/manual tests run on the green slot.
5. **Slot Swap:** After approval, the green slot is swapped with production (blue), making the new version live.
6. **Rollback:** If issues arise, instantly swap back to the previous slot.
